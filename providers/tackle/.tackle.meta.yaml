name: Tackle Provider

description: Hooks that interface with tackle's parser. Core to most tackle scripts.

examples:
  - name: "[debug](debug.md)"
    description: Hook to debug the context. Prints the context and holds the execution for user input.
    content: |
      d->: debug

  - name: "[tackle](tackle.md)"
    description: Run other tackle providers / tackle files
    content: |
      compact_provider->: tackle robcxyz/tackle-provider
      compact_file->: tackle path/to/tackle/file.yaml
      expanded:
        ->: tackle
        input_string: robcxyz/tackle-provider
        checkout: dev  # Branch / version to checkout
        context_file: path/to/file.yaml  # Path to a file within a remote provider
        extra_context:  # Additional context to be brought in when running the tackle provider
          stuff: things

  - name: "[import](import.md)"
    description: Import other tackle providers to allow use of other hooks. Typically run privately - ie `_>` to keep a clean context
    content: |
      compact_>: import robcxyz/tackle-provider
      expanded:
        ->: tackle
        src: robcxyz/tackle-provider
        version: dev  # Branch / version to checkout

  - name: "[block](block.md)"
    description: Run a block of tackle calls so that logic methods (ie `if`, `for`) can be run on a group of keys. Block hooks are common so there is a macro form of this hook (ie no explicit hook call).
    content: |
      stuff: things
      macro_version->:
        if: stuff == 'things'
        stuff->: print other_things
        things->: print "{{ stuff }}" --if "{{ stuff == 'things' }}"

      # Equivalent to
      expanded:
        ->: block
        items:
          merge: true
          stuff->: print other_things
          things->: print "{{ stuff }}" --if "{{ stuff == 'things' }}"

  - name: "[var](var.md)"
    description: Hook to render a variable. `var` hooks are common so there is a macro form of this hook (ie no explicit hook call).
    content: |
      stuff: things
      macro_version->: "{{stuff}}"  # Any hook call that starts with `{{` is considered a var hook
      compact->: var "{{stuff}}"
      expanded:
        ->: var
        input: "{{stuff}}"
        # input's are rendered recursively so this flag only does one level of rendering
        # Useful when the input is itself a template and you don't want it to be rendered
        no_recursion: true

  - name: "[provider_docs](provider_docs.md)"
    description: Extract metadata about the provider
    content: |
      example:
        type: provider_docs
        chdir: ".."
        provider: docs


hook_examples:
  tackle:
    - name: Basic
      description: The most minimal implementation. Call is same as how you would call tackle from command line.
      content: |
        example->: tackle path/to/dir/or/github

    - name: With context
      description: Sometimes you want to ship a specific context in when calling the other tackle.
      content: |
        example:
          ->: tackle path/to/dir/or/github
          extra_context:
            stuff: things

    - name: Remote providers
      description: Providers are often remote so additional parameters are relevant in this setting.
      content: |
        example:
          ->: tackle
          input_string: robcxyz/tackle-provider
          checkout: dev  # Branch / version to checkout
          context_file: path/to/file.yaml  # Path to a file within a remote provider

  block:
    - name: Full form
      description: This is the full form of block and generally is not advised. See short form example.
      content: |
        stuff: things
        block hook:
          ->: block
          items:
            stuff: other things
            things->: var stuff --if "{{ stuff == 'other things' }}"
      output: |
        stuff: things
        block hook:
          stuff: other things
          things: more things

    - name: Short form
      description: Because block hooks are so common, there is a macro that allows calling the hook without an expanded or compact form with simply writine an arrow.
      content: |
        block hook->:
          merge: true  # This merges the output up one level
          stuff: other things
          things->: var stuff
      output: |
        stuff: other things
        things: other things
